<!-- <div style="text-align: justify">  -->
I'm a Master's student at the [Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [PES University](https://cs.pes.edu/).

This summer, I interned at Microsoft as a Data & Applied Scientist Intern in the Bing Ads team where I am developed Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and network architecture search techniques for data-heavy models. Last spring, I interned at Apple as a Machine Learning intern where I worked on few-shot multi-label classification of error logs.

My research interests are broadly efficieny and interpretability in machine learning. I am currently working with [Prof. Emma Strubell](https://strubell.github.io/) on ways to reuse parameters while growing and fine-tuning models. I am also working with [Prof. Yonatan Bisk](https://yonatanbisk.com/) on evaluating the semantic understanding capabilities of text-to-image generation models. Previously, I worked on various other projects and you can find a list of my [publications](pubs.qmd) and my [resume](resumes/Resume_VibhaMasti.pdf).

### Personal Interests

I believe in the power of visual storytelling and teaching. I enjoy making study notes and I was awarded by PES University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering for my immense contributions. Feel free to check out my [notes](notes.qmd)! They are categorized by subject -- most of them are CS subjects, but some are math/science.

I learn to play the South-Indian instrument [Saraswathi Veena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tswRaO-RTgU) in the Carnatic style. I also enjoy cooking and baking quite a bit. I occasionaly enjoy making YouTube videos about my experiences and interests. You can check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@VibhaMasti) if it interests you!
